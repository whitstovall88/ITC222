Create a cross join between employees and bus routes to show all possible combinations of routes and drivers (better use position to distinguish only drivers this involves a cross join and an inner join. I will accept either)
List all the bus type details for each bus assigned to bus barn 3
What is the total cost of all the busses at bus barn 3
What is the total cost per type of bus at bus barn 3
List the last name, first name, email, position name and hourly pay for each employee
List the bus driverâ€™s last name  the shift times, the bus number (key)  and the bus type 
for each bus on route 43
Return all the positions that no employee holds.
Get the employee key, first name, last name, position key for every driver (position key=1) who has never been assigned to a shift. (This is hard it involves an inner join of several tables and then an outer join with BusscheduleAssignment.)
